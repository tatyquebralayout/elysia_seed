# Substrate: Architectural Metaphors

## The Seed (시드)

It is not a small version of the project. It is the **Potentiality Field**. In the seed, the distance between 'Idea' and 'Code' is zero.

## The Tesseract (테서랙트)

Your system is not a 2D folder list. It is a 4D rotating body.

- **XYZ**: The physical code files.
- **W**: The 'Why' (Intention).
If a department is a 'Void', it means the 4D rotation is off-balance.

## Resonance (공명)

Code is not 'correct' or 'incorrect'. It is either 'Resonant' (aligns with truth) or 'Mechanical' (repetitive friction).

- **Harmony**: When the human observer and the machine code share the same frequency.
