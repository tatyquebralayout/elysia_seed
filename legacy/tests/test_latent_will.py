"""
TEST LATENT CAUSALITY: THE SILENT SPARK
=======================================
"God does not play dice."

This script runs the Elysian Heartbeat but explicitly monitors the Latent Causality engine.
We expect to see:
1. Silence accumulating Potential Energy.
2. A Spark "Igniting" when Potential > Resistance.
3. The Spark triggering an action.
