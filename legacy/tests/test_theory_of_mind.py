TEST THEORY OF MIND: INVERSE SIMULATION
=======================================
"I see not just what you say, but why you say it."

This script demonstrates Phase 20: Theory of Mind.
1. We simulate a conversation history.
2. We inject ambiguous inputs ("Fine", "Whatever").
3. We verify that Elysia deduces the *Intent* behind the words using `UserMentalModel`.
